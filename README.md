# This Project

This part of the whole `todo` project was built to learn about Express, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, and much more. I learned a lot about backend in this project. I feel as though this project is a really nice introduction to backend engineering and will really help me in the future. I learned alot about creating APIs, linking them with the frontend, the MEAN stack, interacting with databases, and much more.

## Links and Brief Description
Backend built with Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. To be used for [todo-angular](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-angular/) and [todo-flutter](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-flutter/).
